<p>After you have earned a certificate, you can view your certificates on the <strong>My Records</strong> page. The <strong>My Records</strong> page displays your course completion status for any courses that are part of a program, such as a MicroMasters. On the <strong>My Records</strong> page, you can choose to share your course record with an institution that accepts that course as a step towards admission or completion of a degree program.</p>
