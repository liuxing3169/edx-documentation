   result on the proctoring review.

     - Description
   * - Pending
     - The data from your proctoring session is still being reviewed. You can
       expect results to appear in two or three days.
   * - Satisfactory
     - You have passed the review. If you also achieve the minimum credit
       eligibility grade in your course, you can purchase academic credit.
   * - Unsatisfactory
     - There were either issues with your identity verification or evidence of
       suspicious activity during the exam.

       An **Unsatisfactory** result means that you automatically receive a
       score of 0 for the exam. For most courses, you are no longer eligible to
       purchase academic credit for the course, regardless of your final grade.
       For more information, see the guidelines for your course.
