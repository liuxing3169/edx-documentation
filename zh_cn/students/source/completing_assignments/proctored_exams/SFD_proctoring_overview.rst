Proctored Exams Overview
##############################

.. note::
   Proctored exams are visible only if you are enrolled in the verified track
   for your course. If you are not in the verified track, you take the same or
   an equivalent exam, without proctoring.

   If you want to be eligible for credit for passing your course, make sure you
   enroll in or upgrade to the verified track before the first exam.

Some courses that grant academic course credit require learners to pass at
least one proctored exam. Proctored exams differ from regular exams in the
following ways.

* All proctored exams have time limits. For more information about timed exams,
  see :ref:`taking_timed_exams`.
* Proctored exams require you to install proctoring software on your computer.
* Before you take the exam, you must verify your identity by taking photos of
  your face and a government-issued photo ID.
* Before you take the exam, you must use a webcam to scan the desk and room
  where you will take the exam.
* While you take your exam, the proctoring software monitors your computer,
  including the programs that you have open.
* While you take your exam, the proctoring software also records video and
  sounds.

To be eligible for course credit, you must receive a **Satisfactory** result
for your proctoring session review. For more information about academic course
credit, see :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit`.

Proctored exams are indicated on the **Course** page with a pencil icon and a
