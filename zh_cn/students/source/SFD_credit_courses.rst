******************************
Overview of Academic Credit
******************************

Some edX courses allow you to purchase academic credit that you can apply toward
a degree at a college or university. When a course offers academic credit, you
see a "Credit-Eligible" indication for the course in the edX list of courses.

To earn academic credit for a course, you must enroll in the verified track and
pass the course.

After you meet the course requirements, you have one year after the course
ends to purchase academic credit on edX.org.

.. note:: To complete the process, after you purchase academic credit, you must
   contact the issuing college or university to receive the official notice of
   academic credit, such as a transcript.


*****************************
Enroll for Academic Credit
*****************************

To receive academic credit for a course, you must enroll in the verified track
for the course.

For more information about enrolling, see :ref:`SFD Enrolling in a Course`.

.. note:: To be eligible for academic credit, you must complete the photo ID
   verification process. If you choose not to complete ID verification at any
   time, you are no longer eligible to receive academic credit for the course.
   However, you can still receive a verified certificate in the course.

*****************************
Complete Proctored Exams
*****************************

In a credit-eligible course, you might have to take one or more proctored
exams. Proctored exams are exams that have time limits and that use online
proctoring software to monitor activity. To pass a proctored exam, you must
receive both a passing grade for the exam itself and a "Satisfactory" result
when the recording of your proctoring session is reviewed.

For more information about proctored exams, see :ref:`SFD_ProctoredExams`.


*********************************
Keep Track of Credit Requirements
*********************************

When you are enrolled in a course for academic credit, your **Progress** page
includes a **Requirements for Course Credit** section that lists all of the
requirements that you have to complete to be eligible for credit. This section
indicates your overall credit eligibility status and the status of each
individual requirement.

*****************************
Purchase Academic Credit
*****************************

After you pass the course and meet the requirements for credit, you have up to
one year to purchase academic credit on edx.org.

After you purchase academic credit, you must complete the credit process at
the credit-issuing college or university.

.. note:: More than one organization might offer credit for the same course.
 If this is the case, you select the organization that you want when you
 purchase credit for the course.

To purchase academic credit, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, select **Purchase Credit** next to the course that you
   want.
#. On the **Checkout** page, verify that the organization that you want to
   purchase credit from appears, and then select **Checkout** or **Checkout
   with PayPal**.

#. Follow the instructions to complete the payment process. When the payment
   process is complete, a confirmation page opens, and you receive an email
   message.

#. On the payment confirmation page, select **Complete Credit** to go to the
   credit-issuing organization's website to complete the credit process.

.. note:: After you purchase academic credit, you must contact the issuing
   college or university to complete the credit process. This process usually
   includes receiving the official notice of academic credit, such as a
   transcript.


***************************

   receive an email that indicates whether you have received academic credit for
   the course.
